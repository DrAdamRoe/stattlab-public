# stattlab-public
Welcome to StattLab's public website.

This site is written to be simple and quick. It is written in HTML using CSS and a touch of Javascript. To make it mobile friendly, the entire site's grid is managed by bootstrap. Most code is included via PHP, which allows us to have a natively multi-lingual site. The /blog site is a Wordpress blog which is integrated directly on the site and is not available for local development.

Because we use PHP, a local server environment must be emulated. The simplest way to do this is MAMP (or WAMP).

To get started, clone the GitHub repository locally:

> git clone git@github.com:adamjroe/stattlab-public

Now go into MAMP and set the root directory to be stattlab-public, in whatever folder you cloned it into.

Start MAMP (Start Servers) and navigate to localhost in the browser, you should be able to see the site!

You can download MAMP here: https://www.mamp.info

Here's a brief intro to GitHub. We will probably only need the very basics: git clone, git pull, git push, git add, git commit -m. Make yourself an account on GitHub, send your username to Adam, and have fun!
